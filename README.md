# Movie-Box-Office-Reciepts

This program takes as input the name of a movie and how many adult and
child tickets have been sold.  It then calculates the theater's gross
and net profit for the night.  The theater keeps a percentage of the
revenue from ticket sales, and the remainder goes to the distributor.
